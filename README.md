## 🚀 Try it instantly — no install needed

**→ [https://prospects.streamlit.app/](https://prospects.streamlit.app/)**

Open the link, enter a city, pick your filters and download your CSV in seconds.
No Python, no terminal, no setup required.

`prospect.py` scrapes [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) via the [Overpass API](https://overpass-api.de/) to collect local businesses **without a website**: restaurants, hair salons, mechanics, dentists, tattoo studios, and hundreds of other categories. Results are exported as a clean CSV file ready to hand to a client.

Works in **France, USA, India, UK, Germany**, and anywhere else OSM has data.

# 150 leads in London, only restaurants and cafés
python prospect.py --place "London, UK" --sample 150 --country GB --categories "restaurant,cafe"

# 50 leads via GPS coordinates

nail, tattoo, spa, massage, gym, yoga, dance, cinema, hotel, vet,
dentist, doctor, pharmacy, optician, therapist, lawyer, accountant,

## 📄 Output Format

Each run creates a new numbered file in `prospects_found/`:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `Name` | Business name |
| `Category` | Business type (e.g. *Hair Salon*, *Restaurant*) |
| `Address` | Full postal address |
| `Phone` | Phone number(s) in E.164 format |
| `Email` | Email address (if available in OSM) |

Files use **UTF-8 BOM** encoding so they open correctly in Excel and LibreOffice on all platforms without any import settings.

## 🌐 Country Codes

Use the standard [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) code:

| Country | Code |

| United States | `US` |

## ❓ FAQ

**Why are there fewer results than my `--sample` target?**
OSM data density varies by location. Dense cities return quotas quickly; rural areas may return fewer businesses. Try `--allow-no-address` or `--allow-no-phone` to relax filters.

**Can I run it multiple times for the same city?**
Yes. Each run creates a new numbered file (`prospect1.csv`, `prospect2.csv`…). Phone-level deduplication prevents duplicates *within* a single run, but not across runs.

**Is this legal?**
OpenStreetMap data is open under the [ODbL licence](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/). Any redistribution of the data must credit OpenStreetMap contributors.

**Does it work without `phonenumbers`?**
Yes, with a basic fallback. Numbers may be less precisely normalized. Install `phonenumbers` for full E.164 accuracy across all countries.
